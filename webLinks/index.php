<p>
<a href="http://www.deviantart.com/">DeviantART</a>: A great site to find wallpapers, 
photos, icons, and other artworks by rising artists.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.gimp.org/">The GIMP</a>: A free image editing program that runs on 
both Linux and Windows. This is what I currently use to do raster design on Linux. The 
community support is great, and the software is actively improving.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>: The premiere open source vector editing 
software; runs on both windows and Linux and is a pleasure to use. My personal favorite 
design tool.

<p>
<a href="http://jimmac.musichall.cz/index.php">Jimmac</a>: One of my 
favorite designers. You 
can visit his site to see an always changing, cool design, along with icons, wallpapers, 
and splash screens for open source software. He also has tutorials from time to time, and 
is a master of both GIMP and Inkscape.
